Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.00,00:00:14.32,Default,,0,0,0,,Good morning everyone, my name is Longjie. In this presenttion I'd like to talk about what is inside the nuclei.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:14.20,00:00:17.56,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, let's begin with one question. Have you ever wondered what is the universe made of ?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:17.56,00:00:19.96,Default,,0,0,0,,Or what are humnan beings made of?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:19.96,00:00:22.04,Default,,0,0,0,,Let's consider a simpler question
Dialogue: 0,00:00:22.04,00:00:30.92,Default,,0,0,0,,What is water made of?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:30.84,00:00:37.28,Default,,0,0,0,,From high school learning we've understood that\Nwater is made of water molecular
Dialogue: 0,00:00:37.24,00:00:42.24,Default,,0,0,0,,But what is moceluar made of?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:42.24,00:00:43.56,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, they're made of atoms.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:43.56,00:00:50.56,Default,,0,0,0,,And for water, it is made of H atoms and O atom.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:50.56,00:00:55.20,Default,,0,0,0,,And what is H atom made of ?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:55.24,00:01:03.48,Default,,0,0,0,,Well in college we've understood that H atom is made of electron and proton.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:03.48,00:01:08.48,Default,,0,0,0,,Next question is waht is proton made of?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:08.48,00:01:13.48,Default,,0,0,0,,Well let's begin some history
Dialogue: 0,00:01:13.48,00:01:29.16,Default,,0,0,0,,Discovery of the proton can be tracked back to 1917 when E. Rutherford performed\Nthe scattering of nitrogen atom and α particle.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:29.16,00:01:41.28,Default,,0,0,0,,Another crucial discovery was made\N15 years later by J. Chadwick in his prominent paper with an announcement on possible existence of the new particle named neutron.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:41.28,00:01:46.88,Default,,0,0,0,,Those nucleons were first accepted as elementary particles in nature.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:46.88,00:02:01.56,Default,,0,0,0,,However, a large number of new nucleon-like particles(hadrons in the present day)were discovered with the development of experimental technologies, which revealed that the nucleons are not the most fundamental building blocks
Dialogue: 0,00:02:01.60,00:02:22.24,Default,,0,0,0,,Nowadays, we understood that protons are composed of quarks and gluons (u quark u quark and d quark)
Dialogue: 0,00:02:22.36,00:02:38.56,Default,,0,0,0,,Now we can answer what is the universe made of and human beings made of.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:38.68,00:02:50.64,Default,,0,0,0,,And we are made of atoms. Every atom in your body hides a whirlwind of\Nquarks and gluons, raging at nearly the speed of light!
Dialogue: 0,00:02:50.76,00:03:00.60,Default,,0,0,0,,One may ask how we study them, or how we see the unseeable ?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:01.08,00:03:05.68,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, we study them via colliding of particles.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:06.08,00:03:09.88,Default,,0,0,0,,Here I listed Electron-Ion Collider.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:10.24,00:03:22.04,Default,,0,0,0,,One can see that particles will be accelerated in some rings, and collide at certain locations.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:22.32,00:03:32.08,Default,,0,0,0,,We will measure productions of collisions, and compare the experimental data with the theoretical predictions.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:32.08,00:03:39.40,Default,,0,0,0,,To figure out if there exists new particles or physics beyond standard model.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:39.60,00:03:45.72,Default,,0,0,0,,Specifically, one scattering can be demonstarted as follows.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:46.00,00:03:54.32,Default,,0,0,0,,Here l denotes leptons, bottom line denotes protons.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:54.56,00:04:06.64,Default,,0,0,0,,Here electron penetrates deep into the proton, will produce new particles.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:06.64,00:04:11.64,Default,,0,0,0,,We measure X, or the new particles.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:12.32,00:04:15.20,Default,,0,0,0,,One may ask, why It matters?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:15.28,00:04:20.28,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, there are many unsolved mysteries in particle physics.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:20.44,00:04:33.16,Default,,0,0,0,,The first is spin puzzle, where the measured quark spin contribution was found to be small\N (4% ∼ 24%) to the proton spin.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:33.28,00:04:47.12,Default,,0,0,0,,Which means that we need to take consideration of angular momentum, or the contribution from orbital angular momentum of gluons.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:47.48,00:04:52.48,Default,,0,0,0,,The next is asymmetry of mater and antimatter.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:52.48,00:04:57.48,Default,,0,0,0,,Universe is dominated by matter, not antimatter. We want to find the origin, and test it on collider.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:57.48,00:05:15.80,Default,,0,0,0,,Why collider? Because it will provide the most exreme environment(100000 hotter than heart of sun).
Dialogue: 0,00:05:15.88,00:05:21.44,Default,,0,0,0,,Add next is about the dark matter, or physics beyond the standard model.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:21.60,00:05:27.96,Default,,0,0,0,,In standard model, dark matter and its origin of mass is not included.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:28.20,00:05:34.92,Default,,0,0,0,,So we want to construct the theory that could describe it, and test on colliders.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:35.20,00:05:40.20,Default,,0,0,0,,Thanks for llistening!
